# Work-Term-Report-Template

(CAUTION : THIS IS STILL AN INCOMPLETE BUILD. IT DOES NOT FIT THE UWMATH WKRPT STANDARDS. DO NOT USE IT NOW)
Best of luck on your Work Term Report! You do not require any latex knowledge to use this template. As noted in private communications with the Work Report Team formatting cannot be plagiarized and confirmed I am allowed to share formatting but not content. Please let me know if there are any errors in the template. 

## Installation

1. Download the zip by pressing the "Code" button then clicking "Download ZIP" at the bottom. 
2. Unzip the zip file.
3. Create a new project in overleaf which is a popular and easy to use latex template. If you do not have an account you will need to make one. 
4. Upload these files to your new project.
5. Compile before making any changes. 

## How to Use :
There are certain steps that you need to take to customzie this work term report :
1. If you move the main.tex file anywhere other than the extracted folder, the formatting.sty file **must be on the same folder level** as main.text  
### For new Latex users:

a. Ensure that you have a LaTeX install on your system. If you do not, refer to [LaTeX Tutorial](https://latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/)   
b. Start of by replacing the text "Current Term" in main.tex with the term you last completed. Then click the green button "Recompile".   
c. Next replace the other default text.   
d. Note that any text following a percentage sign is a comment and will not be shown in the pdf.   
d. Also note that between paragraphs there must be at least one blank line. Otherwise the paragraphs will form a giant paragraph!
