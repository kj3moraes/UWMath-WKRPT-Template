% Code Formatting and Code Env

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% This environment is an upgrade from VERBATIM because it highlights identifiers and 
%% keywords in various supported langauges. How to customize :
%%    * Replace the [LANGUAGE_NAME] with the language that you want formatting in.
%%		If you dont want formatting in one specific language, then delete that 
%%		parameter entirely. You will need to specify which language you want formatting 
%%		in every time you use the listings environment. An example is in the main.tex file.
%%	  * To change the spacing between the lines, change the number in the \linespace{}.
%%    * You can change the background colour however you want by altering thr RGB percents
%%		in backcolor's defintion
